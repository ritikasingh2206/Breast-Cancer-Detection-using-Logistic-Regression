# Breast Cancer Classification Using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on various features. The dataset used for this project contains various features such as radius, area, concavity, and fractal dimensions of cell nuclei, which are used to predict the diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) of breast cancer.


## Project Overview

- **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loaded the dataset and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable.

- **Data Preparation:** Preprocessed the data by encoding the target variable and splitting it into training and test sets.

- **Model Development:** Trained a logistic regression model on the training data to predict the likelihood of breast cancer.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and ROC curve on both the training and test sets.

- **Insights:** Discovered insightful relationships between features and the diagnosis through EDA, aiding in understanding the factors influencing breast cancer diagnosis.


## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved an impressive precision and recall on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting breast cancer likelihood.
